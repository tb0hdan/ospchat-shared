/**
 * A peer we have seen at least once via NSD. Persisted by UUID so the peer
 * survives IP address changes, app restarts, and going offline.
 *
 * [lastReadAt] is the high-water mark of inbound messages the local user has
 * acknowledged from this peer; anything newer counts as unread.
 *
 * [avatarHash] / [avatarLocalPath] track the peer's custom avatar (when they
 * have one). `null` for both means we render initials for that peer.
 *
 * [isContact] is `true` when the local user has explicitly saved this peer to
 * their contacts. Contacts remain visible in the Contacts section regardless
 * of online status; non-contacts only render in the Peers section while
 * present in the live NSD snapshot.
