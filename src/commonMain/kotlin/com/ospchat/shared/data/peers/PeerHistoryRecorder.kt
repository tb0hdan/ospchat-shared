/**
 * Writes per-peer history rows (`peer_addresses`, `peer_nicknames`) whenever
 * [PeerRepository.recordSeen] observes a peer in the NSD snapshot.
 *
 * For each (uuid, host:port) or (uuid, nickname) tuple, the first observation
 * inserts a row; subsequent observations advance `last_seen_at`. SQLite's
 * `INSERT OR IGNORE` on the composite primary key keeps the `first_seen_at`
 * stable — we never want to overwrite the original sighting timestamp.
 *
 * After each record, both tables are pruned to the [KEEP_LAST_N] most-recent
 * rows per peer so storage is bounded against pathological churn (e.g. a peer
 * cycling through many DHCP leases or renaming repeatedly).
