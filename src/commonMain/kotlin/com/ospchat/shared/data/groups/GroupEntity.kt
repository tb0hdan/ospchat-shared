/**
 * A group conversation persisted on this device. Every member of a group
 * stores their own copy of the row; the [creatorUuid] identifies who has the
 * authority to mutate the member list. [membershipUpdatedAt] is the
 * snapshot version: the creator bumps it on every add/remove, and receivers
 * only accept newer snapshots from the creator.
 *
 * [lastReadAt] is a per-device unread high-water mark; the unread count is
 * the number of inbound messages with `sent_at > last_read_at`.
